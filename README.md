# WordPress Plugins Directory (GitHub Edition)

Welcome to the **GitHub Edition of the WordPress Plugins Directory**! This repository hosts the same plugins available in the native WordPress directory, but with a GitHub-native approach for management, updates, and downloads.

## Why This Repository?

We’ve moved the plugins directory to GitHub to provide developers and users with:  
- Easier access to plugin code and version history.  
- The ability to fork, contribute, and suggest changes directly.  
- Improved visibility into plugin updates and development processes.

## How It Works  

This repository functions similarly to the native WordPress plugins directory. The key difference is that you’ll need to install a helper plugin to enable seamless searching, downloading, and installing of plugins from this directory.

### Features  
- **Browse Plugins**: Explore all plugins hosted here.  
- **Download and Install**: Use the helper plugin to manage your plugins directly in WordPress.  
- **Stay Updated**: Get updates as easily as you would with the native WordPress directory.
